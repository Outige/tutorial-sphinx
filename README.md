This repo will be used to document the process of getting sphinx to work

### Directory management
```
.
├── docs
│   └── README.md
├── README.md
└── style
    ├── __init__.py
    └── spaces.py
```

Lets start with a very basic layout. We are in some root directoy. Inside of that directory we have `style/` which is a packege where out code will go. You can tell it's a package because of `__init__.py`.

We also have `docs/`. This is where our docs will go. Now cd into docs:

```
$ cd docs/
```
